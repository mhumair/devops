## Sensu

Had a sort session with Ammad bhai related to Sensu. Explored plugins and discussed a bit about the threshold at which the scale your server recommendation is triggered.

# DevOps Essentials

DevOps in a nutshell is a set of practices that help make smoother deployments of code in a scalable reliable and easier to manage way.

Some key concepts/practices include : 

## Build Automation

Often times software needs to go through a set of steps before it is usable. Automating that step helps in finding bugs in code and avoiding major pitfalls in it down the line at the very start saving cruicial time.

## Continous Integration

Continous integration is that changes to code is pushed continously and included build automation too as a step ensuring that frequent merges don't create conflicts or break the code. 

## Continous Delivery 

Continous Delivery is code that's always in a ready state of being deployed. It includes the above step i.e if Continous Integration is being followed in makes Continous Delivery possible.

## Continous Deployment

Able to ship changes frequently i.e the cycle is of dev testing building deploying is smooth and allows for continous changes easily.

## IAC

Infrastructure as code enables the possibility that infrastructure is more consistent, allows reusability and helps in scalability as well.

## Orchestration 

to maintain monitor and scale fleet of instances in an organised way.

## Monitoring 

To be able to log important data to diagnose potential threats or issues in the current infrastructure/application.

## Microservices 

Decoupling complex applications to their seperate responsibilities which results in the ability of indivual parts failing instead of the whole infrastructure/app and to be able to edit/scale indivual apects of the application.
